Challenging Thursdays
=====================

This is a small programming contest judge for "Challenging Thursdays".

After building, the server program can be started as follows, taking
the address of open contests as its arguments:

  $ serv cont1 cont2 ... contN

Each contest is specified as a directory containing several pairs of
files, each of which specify a test case: the file XY, in which X and
Y are both digits, is the input and XYo is the expected output (such
as 00 and 00o).

The server listens on TCP port 40 for incoming connections.  Each
incoming connection can make one of the following requests:

report CONT
	Print submission statistics for contest CONT.
register USERNAME PASSWORD
	Register a user with the given username and password.
submit USERNAME PASSWORD CONT LANG EOF
	Submit a program for contest CONT in language LANG.  This
	command should be followed by the contents of the program,
	followed by a line containing nothing but EOF.  LANG can
	be c for C, c++ for C++, py for Python, and sh for Shell.

The following files are created by the server program.

* USERS: The list of users and their passwords.
* CONT.stat: Submission statistics for contest CONT.
* logs/: Submitted files are stored in this directory.
